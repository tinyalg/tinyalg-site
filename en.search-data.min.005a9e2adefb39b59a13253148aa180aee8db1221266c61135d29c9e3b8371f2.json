Figure: 300 Hz and 200 Hz sine waves (top) and their corresponding Lissajous curve (bottom), illustrating the relationship between frequency ratios and phase differences.\n1. The Basics\r#\rA Lissajous figure is created when two periodic signals are plotted against each other in an X-Y coordinate system: $$\rx(t) = A \\sin(a t)\r$$ $$\ry(t) = B \\sin(b t + \\delta)\r$$ Where: $ A, B $: Amplitudes of the signals. $ a, b $: Angular frequencies of the signals ($ a = 2\\pi f_x$ , $ b = 2\\pi f_y $). $ \\delta $: Phase difference between the signals. 2. Visualizing Phase Differences\r#\rThe shape of the Lissajous figure depends heavily on the phase difference ($ \\delta $):\n$\\delta = 0$: A diagonal line (positive slope) appears when both signals are in phase. $\\delta = \\pi/2$: A perfect circle forms if $ f_x = f_y $ and amplitudes are equal. $\\delta = \\pi$: A diagonal line with a negative slope forms when the signals are 180° out of phase. Intermediate $\\delta$: An ellipse forms, with the tilt and eccentricity determined by the phase difference. Example for Intermediate $\\delta$\r#\r# See code in notebook 3. Visualizing Frequency Ratios\r#\rThe frequency ratio ($ f_x : f_y $) determines the complexity of the Lissajous figure:\n1:1 Ratio ($ f_x = f_y $): The figure is simple and reflects only the phase difference. Examples: Line, circle, or ellipse. 2:1 Ratio ($ f_x = 2 f_y $): The figure has two lobes along the X-axis and resembles a \u0026ldquo;figure-eight.\u0026rdquo; 3:2 Ratio ($ 2 f_x = 3 f_y $): The figure has three lobes along the X-axis and two lobes along the Y-axis. For more complex ratios, the pattern becomes more intricate, often requiring careful analysis to interpret.\nExample for 3:2 Ratio ($ 2 f_x = 3 f_y $)\r#\r# See code in notebook 4. Combined Impact of Phase and Frequency\r#\rShape of the Figure: The phase difference determines the orientation and symmetry (e.g., diagonal line, tilted ellipse, or circle). Complexity of the Figure: The frequency ratio determines the number of lobes or loops in the figure. Example for Combined Phase and Frequency\r#\r# See code in notebook 5. Practical Steps for Visualization\r#\rGenerate Two Signals:\nUse two sinusoidal signals with adjustable frequencies and phase differences. Example: Signal 1: $ x(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f_x t) $ Signal 2: $ y(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f_y t + \\delta) $ Set Up an Oscilloscope:\nConnect Signal 1 to the X-axis and Signal 2 to the Y-axis. Enable X-Y mode on the oscilloscope. Adjust Parameters:\nVary $ f_x : f_y $ to explore different patterns. Adjust $ \\delta $ to observe how the figure changes. Interpret the Results:\nUse the figure’s shape to determine the phase difference and frequency ratio. Summary\r#\rLissajous figures are influenced by phase difference ($ \\delta $) and frequency ratio ($ f_x : f_y $):\nPhase controls the shape (line, circle, ellipse). Frequency ratio determines complexity (loops, lobes).
