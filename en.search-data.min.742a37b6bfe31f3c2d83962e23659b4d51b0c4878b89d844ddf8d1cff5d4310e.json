Over the past week, we’ve been busy building the site using a combination of GitHub Pages and AWS Lightsail, and we’re excited to share the details behind its construction.\nWhether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting to explore the world of microcontrollers, the Waveu site is here to support your journey. Our goal is to provide practical tools, insightful resources, and inspiration to help you create and innovate with confidence.\nMain Site: GitHub Pages\r#\rThe Waveu site is a central resource for Waveu, tailored for microcontroller enthusiasts and professionals.\nHosting: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring a reliable and cost-effective solution for our primary content. Content Creation: We used Hugo to generate the static site and chose the versatile Book theme for a clean and developer-friendly layout. Backend: AWS Lightsail\r#\rThe backend infrastructure is powered by AWS Lightsail, offering flexibility and simplicity for managing additional services.\nWeb Server: We use Nginx as the web server to host. Nginx was selected over alternatives like Apache because of its event-driven architecture, making it highly efficient for serving static files and handling concurrent connections with minimal resource usage. This makes it an ideal choice for our lightweight static website setup.\nAnalytics with Matomo:\nWe use Matomo to track page access and gather insights while respecting user privacy. By avoiding cookies, we ensure a distraction-free experience without intrusive consent popups. Static Website:\ntinyalg.be: A straightforward HTML site for our organization’s main entry point. #\rWe’re excited to see how developers engage with the Waveu site. Whether you’re here to learn, experiment, or collaborate, we encourage you to explore the site and discover what it has to offer. Our GitHub repository is open for contributions and feedback! Join us to explore, experiment, and innovate with microcontrollers. Share your thoughts, bookmark our resources, and stay tuned for future updates—we’re just getting started!\n"}]
